Hi! My name is Alex Baucom and I am passionate about robotics, engineering, and science. I love learning, solving problems, and building things and I want to use these talents to design robots and systems to benefit humanity. Whether that be driverless cars, minimally invasive surgery, space and ocean exploration, or something else, I want to have a part in developing technologies that will improve people’s lives and help further our understanding of the universe.

On a more personal note, I was born and raised in Ventura, CA and went on to get a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Mechatronics from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Upon graduating I got married to my beautiful wife Ashley and moved to Philadelphia, PA to continue my education at the University of Pennsylvania where I received a Master's Degree in Robotics at the GRASP Lab. 

After my degree, I moved to Mountain View, CA where I worked for two years as a Robotic Algorithm and Controls Engineer at Intuitive Surgical. I then spent 9 months developing a robotic security system as Robotics Engineer at Cobalt Robotics. I currently work as a Software Engineer on the Planner team at Waymo helping design the “World’s Most Experienced Driver”. I also had the incredible opportunity to work with Mark Rober on his Domino Robot project which set up over 100,000 dominoes.

In my free time I enjoy reading, playing board games, building robots, experimenting with 3D printing, eating ice cream and optimizing my Factorio layouts.
